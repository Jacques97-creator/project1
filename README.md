Project Description: Real-Time Stock Price Monitor

This project displayed my learned skills in connecting a program to an API and trained my problem-solving abilities. The primary objective was to develop a real-time stock price monitor that retrieves data from a freely accessible API. While the project was straightforward in theory, it presented an interesting challenge due to limitations in the API's data availability.

The API, although providing useful data for free, occasionally experienced interruptions in receiving minute-to-minute information. Consequently, this created gaps in the program's ability to access real-time data for every minute of the trading day. To overcome this obstacle, I devised a solution by optimizing the code structure and implementing conditional loops to ensure the creation of objects for each minute of open market hours while the program was running.

By adjusting variables on the sleep function of the main program loop, I could effectively mitigate the API's data gaps and maintain a consistent flow of information. This adjustment accounted for the API's tendency to have incomplete data towards the end of trading days when liquidity decreases, resulting in intermittent blank entries.

While the API did not offer second-by-second information, I leveraged its capabilities to build a functional program that could easily integrate with a different API providing real-time, second-by-second data for a wider range of stocks and financial assets. This expansion would enable the program to generate alerts based on price fluctuations, identifying potential profit opportunities.

Some Additional Key Learnings I Got from this Project:

   - Mastery of mutable objects: Through this project, I gained a deep understanding of mutable objects and their importance in creating dynamic programs.
   - Handling API malfunctions: The challenges posed by the API's intermittent data availability taught me valuable lessons in managing external dependencies and mitigating potential crashes.
   - Improved API management: I acquired knowledge on best practices for working with APIs, including securing token access keys and safeguarding critical components of the program.
  -  Exploration of cybersecurity: As a result of the project's security considerations, I delved into cybersecurity concepts, enhancing my understanding of protecting sensitive information as the API token key to maintain data integrity.
   - Strengthening programming fundamentals: This project provided an opportunity to reinforce my knowledge in various programming aspects, such as data manipulation, error handling, and algorithmic thinking.

Overall, this project showcases my abilityâ€™s progress to develop robust applications, overcome technical challenges, and adapt to varying data conditions.
